        applicable Law, the remainder of the User Agreement and the application
        of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to
        which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby,
        and each provision of the User Agreement shall be valid and enforceable
        to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Any invalid or unenforceable
        provision of the User Agreement shall be replaced with a provision,
        which is valid and enforceable and most nearly reflects the original
        intent of the invalid and unenforceable provision.
